# Regression Models Comparison

This project compares three regression models — **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest Regressor**, and **XGBoost Regressor** — applied to a tabular dataset.  
Each model is evaluated using standard error metrics to determine which algorithm delivers the best predictive performance.
